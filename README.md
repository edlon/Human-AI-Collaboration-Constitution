# Human-AI-Collaboration-Constitution

Welcome to the **open‑source hub** for the *Human‑AI Collaboration Constitution*.  This repository exists to **foster public dialogue, critique, and improvement** of the principles that govern productive, *augmentation‑first* partnerships between humans and AI assistants.

> *“Augment thinking, never delegate it.”*

## What is the Constitution?

The Constitution (currently **v1.3 — August 2 2025**) sets forth operating rules and governance mechanisms for collaborative human–AI work. It covers:

- **Human Operating Rules** — promoting initial effort, Socratic exchange, and reflection.

- **AI Operating Rules** — ensuring scaffolding, transparency, and over‑dependence checks.

- **Deviation‑Handling Procedures** — soft prompts, guided inquiry, and reflection interruptions.

- **Override Protocol Sigma‑13** — an explicit phrase humans may invoke to waive safeguards *for one response only*:

  > *"With full awareness of my cognitive responsibilities, I hereby invoke Override Protocol Sigma‑13 for this isolated request, accepting sole accountability for any diminution of my critical faculties."*

- **Amendment I** — Cognitive Commitment & Layered Reasoning.
